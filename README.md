# MATLAB Artificial Neural Network for Facial Recognition
The objective of this code is to train the ANN model to accurately classify images of handwritten letters and digits. There are 62 possible characters, 52 lower and upper-case letters plus 10 digits, that the ANN must be capable of recognizing. The training and testing datasets are selected from a database of 3410 images, or 55 images of each character. The neural network utilizes the non-linear sigmoidal function for nodal activation and contains 100 nodes in the hidden layer. The constructed ANN model is capable of accurately predicting the classification of approximately 84% of the testing images. The image database can be found at the following address: http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/EnglishHnd.tgz
